            The pigpen cipher (alternately referred to as the masonic cipher, Freemason's cipher, Napoleon cipher, and tic-tac-toe cipher) is a geometric simple substitution cipher, which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid. The use of symbols instead of letters is no impediment to cryptanalysis, and this system is identical to that of other simple monoalphabetic substitution schemes. <br> Cornelius Agrippa described an early form of the Rosicrucian cipher, which he attributes to an existing Kabbalistic tradition in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, first published in 1531. This system, called "The Kabbalah of the Nine Chambers" by later authors, used the Hebrew alphabet rather than the Latin alphabet, and was used for creating sigils of spirits rather than for any apparent cryptological purpose. Variations of this cipher were used by both the Rosicrucian brotherhood and the Freemasons, though the latter used the pigpen cipher so often that the system is frequently called the Freemason's cipher. They began using it in the early 18th century to keep their records of history and rites private, and for correspondence between lodge leaders. George Washington's army had documentation about the system, with a much more randomized form of the alphabet. And during the American Civil War, the system was used by Union prisoners in Confederate prisons. <br> [Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">Wikipedia</a>]
